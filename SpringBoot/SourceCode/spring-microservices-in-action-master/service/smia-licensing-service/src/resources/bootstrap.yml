## Setting spring
spring:
  application:
    name: licensingservice            # name of service
  profiles:
    active:
      default                         # envrionment (default, dev, prod)
  zipkin:
     baseUrl: http://localhost:9411/  # send tracing information to Zipkin server
     sender:
       type: web                      # because spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka is included in classpath, 
                                      # so Spring will send the trace into Kafka automatically.
                                      # if you still want to send the trace by http, you need to specify the way you want to send explicitly
  cloud:
    config:
      enabled: true                   # retrieve config from config server
      uri: http://localhost:8888      # location of config server
